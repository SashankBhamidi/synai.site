- **Lost Context**: Conversations don't persist across platform switches
- **Inefficient Workflow**: Time wasted switching between different AI interfaces

### Objectives
1. **Unified Access**: Provide single interface for multiple AI providers
2. **Seamless Experience**: Maintain consistent UX across all models
3. **Intelligent Features**: Implement advanced features like model comparison and analytics
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure optimal experience across all devices
5. **Persistent Storage**: Maintain conversation history and user preferences

### Scope
- Integration with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity APIs
- Real-time conversation management with persistent storage
- Responsive web interface optimized for desktop and mobile
- Advanced features including usage analytics and model comparison
- Intelligent prompt suggestions based on selected models

## Technical Deep Dive Questions & Answers

### Q1: Explain your choice of React and TypeScript for this project.
**Answer**: React was chosen for its component-based architecture, which perfectly aligns with the modular nature of the chat interface. TypeScript adds compile-time type safety, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability. The combination enables rapid development while maintaining code quality, essential for a project with multiple API integrations and complex state management.

### Q2: How did you handle the security concerns with API key storage?
**Answer**: API keys are stored locally using browser localStorage with clear user warnings about security implications. The application doesn't transmit keys to any backend servers, maintaining user control. We implemented client-side encryption and provide clear documentation about API key security best practices. For production environments, we recommend server-side proxy implementation.

### Q3: Describe your approach to error handling across multiple AI providers.
**Answer**: I implemented a centralized error handling system with provider-specific error mapping. Each service has try-catch blocks with graceful fallback to simulated responses. Network errors, rate limits, and authentication failures are handled differently, with appropriate user feedback. The system maintains functionality even when some providers are unavailable.

### Q4: How did you ensure responsive design across different devices?
**Answer**: I used a mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS breakpoints. The header reorganizes into a two-row layout on mobile, conversations display in single-column format, and touch interactions are optimized. I implemented separate mobile and desktop component structures where necessary, ensuring optimal experience on all screen sizes.

### Q5: Explain your state management strategy.
**Answer**: I used React Context for global state (settings, current conversation) combined with local component state for UI interactions. Conversation data persists in localStorage with event-driven updates across components. This hybrid approach balances performance with data persistence while maintaining React's unidirectional data flow principles.

### Q6: How did you implement the model comparison feature?
**Answer**: The comparison feature runs parallel API requests to selected models using Promise.all(), displaying results side-by-side with loading states. Each model's response is processed through provider-specific formatting while maintaining consistent UI presentation. Users can export comparison results and copy individual responses.

### Q7: Describe your testing strategy for this project.
**Answer**: I implemented manual testing across multiple browsers and devices, focusing on API integration edge cases, responsive design validation, and user workflow testing. Type safety through TypeScript provides compile-time validation, while console logging and error boundaries handle runtime issues. Future iterations would include automated unit and integration testing.

### Q8: How would you scale this application for production use?
**Answer**: Production scaling would involve implementing a backend proxy for API key management, adding user authentication, implementing proper database storage for conversations, adding rate limiting middleware, implementing comprehensive monitoring and logging, and adding automated testing pipelines. Caching strategies and CDN implementation would improve performance.
